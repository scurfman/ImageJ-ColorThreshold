# ImageJ-ColorThreshold

This repository contains macro programs for color thresholding RGB images. In order for the RGB image to be thresholded using a macro, it has to be converted to a HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) Image. All macros will run the measure function at the end. 

**These macros do NOT work for the batch measure function.**

-The macro titled **"color-threshold"** allows a single image can be color thresholded. To edit it, you go Plugins --> Macros --> Edit... to view the macro code. You can then change the different values (which are labeled) to suit your needs. 

-The macro titled **"batch-Threshold"** prompts for the number of images, and the values for each of the HSB values. The macro defaults the min to 0 and the max to 255. This macro only works for images that are opened separatley. (Ex - This can be done by selecting 30 images and dragging them into the window, allowing each one to open.) The maximum amount of images that can be open will depend on the RAM you have for the program, which can be changed under Edit --> Options --> Memory & Threads. The images will load in the reverse order that they are in a folder, so sort the images in the folder by Z->A.

-The macro titled **"automatic-Batch-Threshold"** will automatically open and measure a inputted number of images. Once the macro is run, a file open dialog will appear. **This is where you select the first image in the folder you want it to measure. Don't select another macro because it will error out.** The macro defaults the min to 0 and the max to 255. 


Macros can be installed into ImageJ (Plugins --> Macros --> Install...), but will be removed everytime the program is restarted.
